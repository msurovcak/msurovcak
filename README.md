### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Director of Platform Engineering at Phrase.

I am generally interested in nice code, purpose, honesty and fun.

Working on my Lenovo T14 I tick all the tech-hipster boxes:

- Arch Linux
- i3wm
- zsh
- vim/Sublime Text
- Source Code Pro
- Python, Ruby (learning Golang)
- AWS
- Ansible, Terraform, Packer, Kubernetes, Helm

Sometimes I do the same on a M1 MacBook Pro.

In free time:

- husband and father
- bike
- beer & burgers

> You have six bikes and one ass
