### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Currently working as Infrastructure Lead at Memsource, making Memsource the best TMS.

I am generally interested in nice code, leadership, honesty and fun.

Working on my Lenovo T14 (used to be a Mac guy), I tick all the tech-hipster boxes:

- Arch Linux
- i3wm
- zsh
- vim/Sublime Text
- Source Code Pro
- Python, Ruby (learning Golang)
- AWS
- Ansible, Terraform, Packer, Kubernetes, Helm

In free time:

- husband and father
- bike (road, DH... you name it)
- cooking, gaming

Living in Prague, CZ
